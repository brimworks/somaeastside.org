# Faith Works

## Passage

James 2:14-26

## Main Point

Faith in Jesus Christ moves us to obey him.  Otherwise, it is not actually faith.

## Sermon Reflections

1. James presents two extremes of so-called faith that aren't really faith. Do these speak to an area where you need to grow in faith?

    - Isolation or insulation from people in your life (all faith, no works)
    - Trying to stack up your accomplishments so you feel like you’ve done enough (all works, no faith)

2. Do you want to follow God but you’re afraid of the consequences? What are some assurances from the Gospel that speak to those fears?
3. Application steps

    - Place your faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ
    - Ask God for eyes of compassion toward believers and non-believers alike
    - Pray for unbelieving neighbors, classmates, coworkers and friends
    - Ask people how you can pray for them - and then do it!
    - Be prepared to give an answer - practice your story
    - Bring people to Jesus
