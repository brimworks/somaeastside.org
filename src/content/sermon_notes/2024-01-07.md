# The Danger of Worldly Wealth

## Passage

James 5: 1-6

## Main Point

### Warning to the Rich

<sup>1</sup> Look here, you rich people: Weep and groan with anguish because of all the terrible troubles ahead of you. <sup>2</sup> Your wealth is rotting away, and your fine clothes are moth-eaten rags. <sup>3</sup> Your gold and silver are corroded. The very wealth you were counting on will eat away your flesh like fire. This corroded treasure you have hoarded will testify against you on the day of judgment. <sup>4</sup> For listen! Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. The cries of those who harvest your fields have reached the ears of the Lord of Heavenâ€™s Armies.

<sup>5</sup> You have spent your years on earth in luxury, satisfying your every desire. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. <sup>6</sup> You have condemned and killed innocent people, who do not resist you.
