# Our Mission

## Soma Eastside Church exists...

    Soma Eastside Church exists to make disciples who seek Jesus and inhabit the Eastside with His saving power and presence.

## Our Identities

WHO WE ARE

- Family - we are children of God who live and care for each other as a family. (Genesis 12:1-3, John 1:12-13, Romans 12:10-16)

- Missionaries - we are sent by God to restore all things to himself (John 1:14, 20-21, Colossians 1:19, 2Corinthians 5:17-21)

- Servants - we are servants of God who serve others as a way of life (Matthew 20:25-28, John 13:1-17, Philippians 2:5-11)

## Ministry

HOW WE DO MINISTRY

- We meet throughout the week in [Missional Communities](../ministries/mission_communities.md).  Following Jesus is done every day, not only on Sunday mornings.

- Sunday morning gatherings to celebrate what God has done, connect with our church family, and equip ourselves to live out the gospel.

- Youth ministry (middle school and high school) to equip the youth on the Eastside to follow Jesus and live out their faith

- Build strong families through Soma Kids ministry and gospel-centered parenting resources
