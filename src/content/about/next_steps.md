# Next Steps

## Everyone has a next step.  What's Yours?

At Soma Eastside, we are a family of families following Jesus.  This means we take active steps as Jesus leads us. **What are your next steps?**

If you have recently made a decision to follow Jesus, recommit your life to Jesus, or want to get to know more about God, fill out this [form](https://somaeastside.churchcenter.com/people/forms/388163). We want to connect you with the resources to take your next step.

The Apostle Paul compared following Jesus to running a race:

> *12* I donâ€™t mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me. *13* No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, *14* **I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.**  *(Philippians 3)*

## I'm New To Learning About Jesus

**Learn about Jesus and consider his claims.**

- Read through the gospel of Mark (in the New Testament) and try to answer the question, "Who is Jesus?"

**Discipleship** - "making disciples who make disciples"

- Is there someone around you that you can teach and encourage them as they grow in their walk with Jesus?
- Is there someone around you that you look up to, who could teach and encourage you in your walk with Jesus?
- Not sure where to start?

  1. Talk to your MC leader or one of the Elders. Let them know you're interested in building a discipleship relationship.
  2. Work through our [Membership Covenant](https://4fa683dbbab7e13223dd-857127945a9474a7e047546272830378.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploaded/s/0e12250570_1619116096_soma-eastside-membership-covenant.pdf). Use that to help you identify places to grow and learn.
  3. Work through a Bible Study or devotional with your discipleship partner. As questions or topics of interest come up, look into those together.
